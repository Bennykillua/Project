We would like to develop a model that predict the taxi-out time for an aircraft 2 hours before the scheduled depature time. We would like to pitch its approach to this specific problem and how the use of prediction from such a model can be used to fuel client's aircraft with more predictions and hopefully save money by putting less fuel onboard.

Data is available online. There are a lot of historical flight and taxi outime data can be found on the Bureau of Transportaion Statistics Website.

Data set can be gotten from Bureau of Transportaion Statistics [Website](https://transtats.bts.gov/)
