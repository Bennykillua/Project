# Space STEM Solar Eclipse #

In this project we look at the effects on our micro-climate during a total solar eclipse.

Background Information: 

i)   Great video pre-dating eclipse [Here](https://youtu.be/Qog18tiNnqg)

ii)  Full lesson [Here](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-creates-a-total-solar-eclipse-andy-cohen)

iii) The eclipse photo that made Einstein famous [Here](https://youtu.be/HLxvq_M4218)

Now you are ready to tackle the project.
The data set has been emailed to you, or you could download it from the dashboard. Search for "Solar Eclipse Unit 2 - Quest"

use the dataset to answer; 

1) Looking at the graphs and the data, what do the trends tell you?

2) Using the date and time of the data collected (in the spreadsheet) and accessing the map of the solar eclipse, where was the data collected?

3) Using the Correlation function in your spreadsheet, identify the relationships between the data sets:
    - Light (Lux) and Temperature 
    - Light (Lux) and Humidity
    - Light (Lux) and Atmospheric Pressure
