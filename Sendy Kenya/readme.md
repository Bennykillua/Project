# Sendy #

Sendy is the delivery partner for moving packages in Kenya. Sendy provides an app and web platform that enables (small) businesses to connect with drivers and request ondemand or scheduled package delivery services anytime, any day, 24/7.
Partnership is the foundation of what we do. By partnering with Drivers and Businesses, we empower individuals to grow their livelihood. We do this by building a platform that is simple, transparent, and user Centric. Our goal is to be the preferred delivery partner in Africa.
Prepare a presentation that includes the answers to the tasks described below:

1. Using the attached dataset, analyse the order cancellations and visualize the most important aspects using your preferred method. Document your steps if needed. Furthermore, recommend how to reduce the number of cancelled orders.

2. Some of the data have been lost (read: we have deliberately deleted them from the data sheet). Please use the existing data set to “predict” the cancellation reason for all orders with missing data (Sheet 2). Please document your steps and method used.
