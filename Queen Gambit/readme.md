# Queen Gambit #

Chess is played on an 8x8 board between two players, white and black, where white always has the first move. Chess moves are recorded using algebraic chess notation, which specifies which piece moves to which square on the board. The numbering and lettering of the chess board is oriented to the white playerâ€™s position.
Like each square for the chessboard, each chess piece also has a specific notation:
King: K
Queen: Q
Bishop: B
Knight: N (K is already taken)
Rook: R
Pawn: No notation (if a move indicates only a square, it's a pawn).
