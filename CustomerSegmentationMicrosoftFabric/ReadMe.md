This platform caan be used to handle your data storage and migration to your real-time data analytics, data science projects, and data engineering workflow.

You can find the article for this project on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news) via this link.

In this guide, we'll introduce you to Microsoft Fabric and give you a better understanding of its capabilities.

This notebook shows how to:

- Use Kaggle Data in Microsoft Fabric.
- Explores data Wrangler.
- Perform customer segmentation in Microsoft Fabric.
- Save your data and predictions in your Lakehouses.
